After downloading, please, in your terminal:

npm install express

Create a VERY SIMPLE API in Node and Express that manipulates an array of in-memory objects.

  * HINT: Recall from BEW1.1 that the HTTP methods we use help tell a great story!
      * *GET* fetches an object or a list of objects.
      * *POST* adds a new object to the array.
      * *PUT* modifies an object in the array.
      * *DELETE* removes the object from the array.
